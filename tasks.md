# Fixes

- Because we only check player input every 4 ticks, inputs are repeated when rejecting a purchase

# Questions

- We only check inputs periocially to make it easier to stay in a diagonal direction. We may need to check button input every tick or ranged attack firing rate can be limited. Also the issue with sticky direction above.
